-- This is the main module for image processing and conversion.

-- The module exposes normalization of dynamic images into classical 8-bit RGBA images,
-- provides access to conversions between an image and repa array and the most

-- | Classical 8-bit RGBA image.
--
-- Each pixel has four 8-bit channels: red, green, blue and alpha.
--
type RGBAImage = P.Image P.PixelRGBA8


-- | The delayed two-dimensional array of arbitrary value.
-- In the delayed array values are represented as
-- functions to element values.
--
-- Delayed arrays should be explicitly evaluated
-- in order to produce the actual value.
--
type DelayedArray a = R.Array R.D R.DIM2 a


-- | Fully evaluated and unboxed array.
--
type UnboxedArray a = R.Array R.U R.DIM2 a


-- | Classical 8-bit RGBA pixel in form of tuple.
--
-- This pixel representation is used when an 'RGBAImage' is converted
-- into 'DelayedArray' for further parallel processing. Another use-case
-- is representation of the character color.
--
type RGBA8 = (P.Pixel8, P.Pixel8, P.Pixel8, P.Pixel8)


-- | This tuple basically represents a char
-- that should be rendered with the specified
-- color.
--
type ColoredChar = (Char, RGBA8) 


-- | The average brightness of a dedicated area of an image or
-- a total average brightness of a specific character.
--
type Brightness = Word8


-- | The brightness map is used during the image
-- conversion to ASCII art. Every character has a relative
-- brightness that could be used to substitute a dedicated
-- area of an image. The brightness map defines a dictionary
-- that is used during the substitution. Different dictionaries
-- produce different image conversion result.
--
type BrightnessMap = ML.Map Brightness Char 


-- | Given the image and the specification,
-- converts the image to a colored ASCII art.
-- The ASCII art is represented as 'DelayedArray' of 'ColoredChar'
-- and, as a result, is not fully evaluated.
